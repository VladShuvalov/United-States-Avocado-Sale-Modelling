# Exploring the Domestic Sales of United States Avocadoes 
  
In recent years avocado has seen a rise in popularity in North America. Avocado has become a staple in many of the popular food items we see today. With the rise in popularity we've seen a sharp increase in the prices of avocado in grocery stores and additional charges for avocado in cafes and fast food restaurants. 

In this analysis we will explore the 2015-2018 domestic sales of United States avocadoes through data provided by the Hass Avocado Board and the U.S. Census Bureau. We'll analyze the price and sale focusing on:
 *  Effects of growing popularity of avocado
 *  Regional changes over time
 *  Creating a classifier to predict whether an avocado was grown organically or conventionally
 
### Summary of Results
  
After analyzing the data, we have concluded that there was a major surge in avocado prices in several metropolitan regions between 2016 and 2017. The increase in price was primarily the cities with higher demand for organically grown avocado. The high demand and low crop yield caused a surge in avocado price.
