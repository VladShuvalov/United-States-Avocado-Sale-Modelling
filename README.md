# Exploring the Domestic Sales of United States Avocadoes 
  
In recent years avocado has seen a rise in popularity in North America. Avocado has become a staple in many of the popular food items we see today. With the rise in popularity we've seen a sharp increase in the prices of avocado in grocery stores and additional charges for avocado in cafes and fast food restaurants. 

In this analysis we will explore the 2015-2018 domestic sales of United States avocadoes through data provided by the Hass Avocado Board and the U.S. Census Bureau. We'll analyze the price and sale focusing on:
 *  Effects of growing popularity of avocado
 *  Regional changes over time
 *  Creating a classifier to predict whether an avocado was grown organically or conventionally
 
# Conclusion

Avocado have seen a large increase in price 2016-2017 primarily organic avocado. California, the state in which [90% of domestic avocado are grown](https://fsi.colostate.edu/avocados/) saw a drought accompanied with the [protests of Mexican farmers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mexican-protests-could-signal-fluctuating-avocado-prices-this-season-1.4908341) brought a scarcity in supply.

Organic avocado account for less than 5% of the avocado sold in the United States. The affect the drought and protests on an already low supply caused surges in price. The low volume of organic avocado caused a high classification rate in our model due to volume being highly correlated with the response.
